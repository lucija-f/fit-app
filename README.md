# FitApp
FitApp is an Android fitness guide with two main options. The first option has eight exercises to choose from. When the user chooses an exercise, the app will automatically start 
a 5 sec countdown to get ready and after that it will count down 10 sec for exercise.
The second option is for calculating BMI. The user needs to insert their weight, height and date of measurement. After that, by clicking on the CALCULATE button, a BMI result is 
displayed with a color that informs the user of their BMI range. Red indicates obese, yellow indicates overweight and green is for normal. Every BMI checkpoint can be saved 
by clicking on the button ADD and all saved results will be shown in CHECKPOINTS by clicking on SHOW. Also, all checkpoints can be deleted by clicking DELETE.
